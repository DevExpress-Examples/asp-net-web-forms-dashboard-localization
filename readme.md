# Dashboard for ASP.NET Web Forms - Localization

The example shows how to localize an ASP.NET Web Forms Dashboard application:

- Translate UI element captions to a different language: dialog boxes, buttons, menu items, error messages, etc.
- Format numbers, dates, and currencies according to specific culture settings.

## Example Structure

The example contains two projects that show how to localize the Web Dashboard control in case _automatic_ or _manual_ script integration. Both projects localize the ASP.NET Web Forms Dashboard control for the German market with the [satellite resource assemblies](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400833/web-dashboard/aspnet-web-forms-dashboard-control/localization#localize-ui). The control uses Globalizeï»¿ to format to dates, numbers, and currencies. 

The example also shows how to apply custom formatting for numbers and dates.

### Automatic Script Registration

<!-- default file list -->
*Files to look at*:

* [Default.aspx](./CS/DashboardLocalizationWeb/Default.aspx)
* [Web.config](./CS/DashboardLocalizationWeb/Web.config)
<!-- default file list end -->

The **DashboardLocalizationWeb** project registers client libraries automatically. Globalize is included when you [register third-party libraries](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/402121/web-dashboard/aspnet-web-forms-dashboard-control/required-client-libraries#automatic-integration).


### Manual Script Registration

<!-- default file list -->
*Files to look at*:

* [Default.aspx](./CS/DashboardLocalizationManualWeb/Default.aspx)
* [Web.config](./CS/DashboardLocalizationManualWeb/Web.config)
<!-- default file list end -->

The **DashboardLocalizationManualWeb** project prevents the Web Dashboard control from loading client libraries automatically and references [Globalize and other libraries](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/402121/web-dashboard/aspnet-web-forms-dashboard-control/required-client-libraries#manual-integration) on the web page.
